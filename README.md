# **Predicting the Risk of Default on Home Credit**

A Data Science Approach to Supporting Credit Granting Decisions

## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to predict loan default risk using the Home Credit Default Risk dataset, which contains comprehensive customer information, credit history, and payment records. The analysis involves in-depth data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering from multiple data sources to build machine learning and deep learning models that can assist financial institutions in assessing creditworthiness more accurately.

## 🎯 Business Problem
